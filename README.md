Hi! I’m Arthur F. Rossignol!
I am a French engineer civil servant trainee within the ‘Corps des IPEF’ under the French Ministries of Agriculture and Ecological Transition.
I graduated from École polytechnique (biology and chemistry) and University Paris-Saclay (ecological modelling and conservation ecology). 
I will start a PhD in August 2025 in statistics for species distribution models and forest ecology.
