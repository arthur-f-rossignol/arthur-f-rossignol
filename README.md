Hi! I’m Arthur F. Rossignol!
I am a French engineer civil servant within the ‘Corps des IPEF’ under the French Ministries of Agriculture and Ecological Transition.
I graduated from École polytechnique majoring in chemistry and biology.
I am now enrolled in University Paris-Saclay where I study conservation ecology and ecological modelling. 
My current work involves modeling the distributions of phytoplankton species along the water column in freshwater lakes.
