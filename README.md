Hi! I’m Arthur F. Rossignol!
I am a French engineer civil servant within the ‘_Corps des IPEF_’ under the French Ministry of Agriculture.
I graduated from École polytechnique (biology and chemistry) and University Paris-Saclay (ecological modelling and conservation ecology). 
I began a PhD in September 2025 in biostatistics and community ecology under the supervision of Dr. Frédéric Gosselin.
